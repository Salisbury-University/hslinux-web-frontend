I'm trying to make the user Dark Mode preferences save and persist throughout logins and for different users.

To do this, I'm going to have to use the backend database that they've created
    When a user updates their dark mode pref, it'll update it in the database and save it, and when they log in to the page
    it'll load their preferences from the database and load it



*Prisma CRUD

[DONE] // TODO - Figure out how to use the two dummy logins to log in without having to use the API

then after that

// TODO - Figure out how to read and write from the database

then we can

// TODO - Read and write the user's dark mode preferences in real time, and when they log in or out to be able to
    A. When the user logs out of the page or is not logged in to begin with, the page will revert to LIGHT MODE.
    B. When the user logs in, it will query the database to get their Dark Mode Preference, and update the page accordingly.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have the usernames and passwords for the two dummy users

User 1
    Alice
    somepass

User 2
    Bob
    passsome

So we just need to make an API call to this prisma database instead of the LDAP API

How do???
